  ## Project Description:
  ### GatherNow is an interactive/mobile first app tailored for the spontaneous individual looking for Impromptu Adventurers, locally. The app is designed so users can sign-in and post or join impromptu local activies on an individual or small group basis within a 24 hour time slot. Are you new in town, perhaps interested in meeting new friends, or maybe a new hobby and would like to meet other like-minded individuals but short on time?  GatherNow is your gateway to an Impromptu Adventure!
